Guardian Travel Book
====================

#Introduction 

A location aware web application, which shows Guardian travel articles near you. 
The initial version was knocked up over a few nights (Scotch driven development).
I'd love to extend this to a more complete travel website, using geotagged content from multiple sources.

# Tech

- Scala/Lift
- MongoDB
- Guardian Content API

# Credits

I got quite a bit of inspiration from (https://github.com/tackley/travel-map) - it is doing something similar to what I wanted, which made it almost too easy.
